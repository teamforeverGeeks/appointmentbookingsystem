		From an astronomical view, the equinoxes and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons,
		 but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal insolation,
		  often identified with the 21st day of June or December. A variable seasonal lag means that the meteorological 
		  centre of the season, which is based on average temperature patterns, occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation.[3] The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere and the months of December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere.Under meteorological definitions, all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning. </b>
